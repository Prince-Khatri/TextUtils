This are notes for django

First Know about views and urls 

    -view is the file which contains the http front rend set

    -urls helps to show those content

#For showing the content of Text file

    open the text file in the directory and take the content in a variable

    content = file.read()

    then return that in HttpResponse(f"< pre >{content}/< / pre >")
        {Don't use extra space in html attribute}

        pre helps to preserve the whitespace and newline character

        an f string  is used to sent this content
